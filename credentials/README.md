# Instructions

Below you will find the instructions on how to connect to the host and the database.


# Host

The server is hosted on Microsoft Azure platform. You can find the SSH key in this folder. You should be able to use the key by specifying the **-i** flag in SSH command or importing it directly into an SSH client like **Termius** or **Bitvise SSH Client**. The username is "gdsdteamthree".


# Database

Mysql v8 is up and running on the server. You can connect to it via the following credentials. You can use the default port (3306):

**Host**: 40.118.121.196
**Username**: dba
**Password**: GdsdT3@

I suggest using **Azure Data Studio** with MySQL extension.
